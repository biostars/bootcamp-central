## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Let us write some code to generate random normals and draw a histogram 

```{r Normal, echo=TRUE}
x = rnorm(1000, mean=2, sd=3)
hist(x, main="N(2,9)", xlab="Random numbers", nclass=50)
```


## Simulation Study example


We first generate phenotypic scores randomly for 20 samples. We will have these phenotypic scores in *pheno*

```{r Phenotype, echo=TRUE}
nsamp = 20
pheno = rnorm(nsamp)
```

Next we create a matrix for 1000 genes and gene expression data created randomly for the 20 samples.  

```{r gene_exp, echo=TRUE}
ngenes = 1000
genes = matrix(rnorm(ngenes*nsamp), ncol = nsamp)
```

We would like to compute the correlation between the phenotype score and the gene expression data
```{r correlation, echo=TRUE}
trans = t(genes)
corr = cor(trans, pheno)
dim(corr)
hist(corr, main="Correlation for 1000 genes")
```

We select top 10 genes as these have the highest predictive power of phenotypic score from gene expression 
```{r topgenes, echo=TRUE}
nsel = 10
selgenes = order(corr, decreasing = TRUE)[1:nsel]
sigGenes = genes[selgenes,]
```  
  
We do linear regression analysis to get the $R^2$
```{r reg, echo=TRUE}
regout=lm(pheno~t(sigGenes))
R2=var(fitted(regout))/var(pheno)
anova(regout)
R2
```


To generate a null distribution by running the simulation repeatedly 
```{r simFunction}
simR2=function(nsamp=20,ngene=1000,nsel=10){
  if (nsel >= nsamp-1) stop("The number of genes selected must 
                            be less than the sample size")
  pheno=rnorm(nsamp)
  genes=matrix(rnorm(nsamp*ngene),ncol=nsamp)
  cors=cor(t(genes),pheno)
  selgenes=order(cors,decreasing=TRUE)[1:nsel]
  sigGenes=genes[selgenes,]
  R2=var(fitted(lm(pheno~t(sigGenes))))/var(pheno)
  c(maxAbsR=max(abs(cors)),minR=min(cors),maxR=max(cors),Rsq=R2)
}
```

Now we run it for 1000 iterations
```{r runSim}
# Create a 1000 row matrix whose 4 columns will contain the returned values from simR2 function
simN20G1000S10=matrix(nrow=1000,ncol=4)
for (i in 1:1000) simN20G1000S10[i,]=simR2(nsamp=20,ngene=1000,nsel=10)
```

We can view the plot of the sampling distribution for the absolute largest correlation, largest corrrelation, smallest correlation and $R^2$

```{r histNULL,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(simN20G1000S10[,1], nclass=50,main="Distribution of Largest Absolute Correlation",xlab="Maximum Absolute Correlation")
hist(simN20G1000S10[,2], nclass=50,main="Distribution of Smallest Correlation",xlab="Minimum Correlation")
hist(simN20G1000S10[,3], nclass=50,main="Distribution of Largest Correlation",xlab="Maximum Correlation")
hist(simN20G1000S10[,4], nclass=50,main="Distribution of R-square of Selected Genes",xlab="R-square")
```


For example, if the largest absolute correlation between phenotypic score and gene expression is 0.68, the p-value for this is the proportion of our simulations that produced a value at least as large.

The p-value is `r round(mean(simN20G1000S10[,1]>=.68),4)`.

Although the 0.68 would be a large correlation if there were only one gene being tested, it is a fairly typical value for the maximum when there are 1000.
