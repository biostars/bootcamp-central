In this session we will discuss the reproducibility crisis in science and we will go over materials that will help us make our research reproducible. 

We will have a look at [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) (an online markdown-based tool for lab notebook), we will learn how to use GitHub and Git for version control, as well as Galaxlay for bioinformatics analysis.
