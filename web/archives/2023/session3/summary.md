### Session 3: Bioinformatics Resources, Snakemake, Pytest

#### Instructors: Chunyu Ma & Shaopeng Liu

In this session, we will go through common bioinformatics resources and show examples of some useful tools (e.g. [GNU Parallel](https://www.biostars.org/p/63816/)). We will also utilize an ATAC-seq analysis pipeline as a base to introduce [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a popular workflow management tool. Finally, we will simply introduce how to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/) in Python.
