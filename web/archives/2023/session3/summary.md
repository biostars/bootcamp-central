### Session 3: Bioinformatics Resources, Snakemake, Pytest

#### Instructors: Chunyu Ma & Shaopeng Liu

In this session, we will go through common bioinformatics resources and show examples of some useful tools (e.g. <a href="https://www.biostars.org/p/63816/" target="_blank">GNU Parallel</a>). We will also utilize an ATAC-seq analysis pipeline as a base to introduce <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Snakemake</a>, a popular workflow management tool. Finally, we will simply introduce how to use <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/" target="_blank">Pytest</a> in Python.
