### Session 3: Bioinformatics Resources, Snakemake, Pytest

#### Instructors: Chunyu Ma & Shaopeng Liu

In this session, we will go through the common bioinformatics resources (e.g., public data and computational tools). We will also utilize an ATAC-seq analysis pipeline as a base to introduce [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a popular workflow management tool. Finally, we will simply introduce how to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/) in Python.
