## Python Primer (Pytest)
<br/>
Testing is crucial in software development. Before a software product reaches the end-user, it typically undergoes various tests including integration tests, systems tests, and acceptance tests. The basic level of software testings are called `unit tests`, a form of automated testing. If you're working in the field of computational biology, you usually need to develop some algorithms or software. Learning how to do unit tests can greatly benefit your research.

In this part, we will learn how to use a popular Python testing framework `Pytest`. It is open-source and allows developers to write concise test suites for unit testing, functional testing, and API testing. Compared with the Python built-in testing framework `Unittest`, I think it is more flexible and convenient.

### Prerequisite
Basic knowledge about Python is required.

### Basic Usage
Since Pytest is a third-party framework, you will need to first install this package, simply via a pip command:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
