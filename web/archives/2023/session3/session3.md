### Session 3: Bioinformatics Data Overview and Metagenomics Snakemake-based Workflow

#### Instructors: Chunyu Ma & Shaopeng Liu

In this session, we will go through the common bioinformatics data (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, metagenomics data), and leverage a metagenomics analysis pipeline as a base to introduce [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a popular workflow management tool.
