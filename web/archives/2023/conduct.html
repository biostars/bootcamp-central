    <p>
        We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for
        everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment
        in any form, including offensive communication, sexual images in public
        spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
        photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
        inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

    <p>
        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
        professionally. Remember that sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are
        not appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately. Anyone violating these rules may be asked to leave the
        classroom at the sole discretion of the instructors.
    </p>
    <p>
