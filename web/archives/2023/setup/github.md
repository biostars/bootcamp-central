## Git & GitHub Account

You will need [Git][] installed and an account on [GitHub][] for the section on version control.

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/
[GitHub]: https://github.com/

Some systems come with Git pre-installed. You can check if you already have Git via the command line interface by typing `git --version`. If you need to install Git, refer to [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for instructions.

In Session 3, you will use password authentication to
communicate with GitHub. This is required to ensure that the instructions are reproducible by all participants. 

**If you run into any issues, feel free to contact Maxwell Konnaris: mak6930@psu.edu**
