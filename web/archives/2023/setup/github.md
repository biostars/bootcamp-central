## Git & GitHub Account

You will need <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> installed and an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the section on version control.

Some systems come with Git pre-installed. You can check if you already have Git via the command line interface by typing `git --version`. If you need to install Git, refer to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">install git</a> for instructions.

In Session 3, you will use password authentication to
communicate with GitHub. This is required to ensure that the instructions are reproducible by all participants.
