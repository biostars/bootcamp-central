 ## ICDS Cluster Resources Account

During the boot camp, we will use resources provided by the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS). To access the resources provided by the ICDS Cluster Resources, you need to follow these steps:

* For incoming graduate students, activate your PSU student account

* Enable [two-factor authentication](https://accounts.psu.edu/2fa) for your PSU account

* [Request an ICDS-ACI account.](https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu/) Use the research description: "2023 Data Reproducibility Bootcamp" and list [Dr. David Koslicki](https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/david-koslicki) (dmk333) as your sponsoring account. Under “ICDS Linux Clusters,” check “Roar Collab.”

Please do this **by the end of Friday (2023/08/07)** since it can take a few days for the account request to process.

If you already have access to the cluster, this is not required.
